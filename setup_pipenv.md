Make sure you have pipenv installed on your system. If not, you can install it by running pip install pipenv.

Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.

Create a new pipenv environment by running pipenv --python 3.8. You can replace 3.8 with the version of Python you want to use.

Activate the pipenv environment by running pipenv shell. You should see the name of your environment in your terminal prompt now.

// dont do this: Install the required packages for your script inside the pipenv environment. You can do this by running pipenv install tensorflow matplotlib argparse.
// use pip file


Copy your script and any required files into the project directory.

Run your script by running python your_script.py inside the pipenv environment. If you need to pass any arguments to your script, you can do so by adding them after the script name.

To exit the pipenv environment, simply run exit.

That's it! You should now be able to run your script in a pipenv environment with all the required dependencies installed.
